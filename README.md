# Effective Java Musings

Contrived (or sometimes practical) implementations of **items** of the book: `Effective Java`. 

Mostly, the sources are from the book itself, as found [here](https://github.com/marhan/effective-java-examples).

Note: Everything detailed in the book is not implemented. 

## Extra Notes

- To enable assertions, use the `-ea` flag.

```
java -ea -cp build/libs/EffectiveJavaMusings.jar ejm.chapter07.item38.App
```

- To generate docs for java files in a package:

```
javadoc -d <destination-directory> <source-directory>/*.java
```
